# BasisPantry 52 – Usage

This directory contains a preconfigured pantry preset for nutritionOS.

## Basic principle

nutritionOS explicitly allows users to manually define and maintain their own food inventories.  
If you do that, **you do not need this preset**.

This preset is intended for users who do not want to manually enter their pantry  
and prefer to work with a ready-to-use, everyday baseline instead.

## Using the preset

When this pantry preset is loaded, nutritionOS assumes that  
the foods listed here are **generally available**.

Based on that assumption, the system:
- designs recipes
- suggests meals
- combines ingredients into everyday dishes

For this to work reliably, the listed foods should actually be available  
in your pantry.

The list below can be used as a **shopping list**.

## Customizing the preset

This preset is **optional** and can be modified.

If you do not want to use a specific food:

1. Remove the corresponding entry from the **index list**
2. Remove the associated food entry including its nutritional values  
   from the food database file

After removal, nutritionOS will assume that the food is **not available**  
and will no longer use it in its suggestions.

## Note

This pantry preset is a **convenience option**.  
It does not sell functionality or recommendations,
but reduces setup effort when getting started with nutritionOS.
