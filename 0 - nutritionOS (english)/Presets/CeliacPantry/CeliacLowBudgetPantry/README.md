# CeliacLowBudgetPantry – Usage

This directory contains a preconfigured, cost-conscious
gluten-free pantry preset for nutritionOS.

## Basic principle

nutritionOS explicitly allows users to manually define and maintain
their own food inventories.  
If you do that, **you do not need this preset**.

This preset is intended for users with celiac disease
or a gluten-free diet who prefer not to manually enter all foods
and want to work with a deliberately reduced, budget-oriented baseline.

## Using the preset

When this pantry preset is loaded, nutritionOS assumes that
the listed foods are **generally available**
and gluten-free.

Based on that assumption, the system:
- designs simple gluten-free recipes
- suggests everyday meals
- combines ingredients with cost and availability in mind

For this to work reliably, the listed foods should actually be available
in your pantry.

The list below can be used as a **shopping list**.

## Included foods (CeliacLowBudgetPantry)

- Rice  
- Potatoes  
- Corn grits / polenta

## Customizing the preset

This preset is **optional** and can be modified.

If you do not want to use a specific food:

1. Remove the corresponding entry from the **index list**
2. Remove the associated food entry including its nutritional data
   from the food database file

After removal, nutritionOS will assume that the food is **not available**
and will no longer use it in its suggestions.

## Note

This pantry preset is a **budget-oriented convenience option**
for everyday gluten-free nutrition.

It is not a medical or therapeutic product
and does not replace professional medical advice.
