# Notice for Users with Celiac Disease

I am **not a doctor** and **not a nutritionist**, and I am **not providing medical advice**.  
This preset is **not** a medical recommendation, not a treatment guide, and **not** a guarantee of gluten-free safety.

The foods listed here are categories that I **assume might typically be available** in gluten-free or gluten-free-certified versions, and that *might* be suitable for people with celiac disease.  
However, I **do not know** whether individual products or batches are contaminated.  
I **cannot guarantee** that anything in this list is safe.

Manufacturing, transport, and processing can lead to **cross-contamination**, even in foods that are normally gluten-free.  
Even **certified gluten-free** products can occasionally be contaminated.

**If you choose to use this preset, you do so entirely at your own risk.**  
I am **not advising** you to use any of the listed foods without checking them.  
Please **always check ingredient labels**, **always check the manufacturer's information**, and use **only explicitly certified gluten-free products** when required.

If you ask a language model (LLM) for recipes, **always add: “Careful, I have celiac disease!”**  
I cannot take **any responsibility** for errors or oversights made by an LLM.

This preset is provided solely as a **structural guide** – not a safety guarantee.
