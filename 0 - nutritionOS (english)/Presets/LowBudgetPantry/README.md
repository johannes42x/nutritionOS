# LowBudgetPantry – Usage

This directory contains a preconfigured, cost-conscious pantry preset
for nutritionOS.

## Basic principle

nutritionOS explicitly allows users to manually define and maintain
their own food inventories.  
If you do that, **you do not need this preset**.

This preset is intended for users who want to work within a limited budget
and prefer not to manually enter all pantry items,
using a reduced and practical baseline instead.

## Using the preset

When this pantry preset is loaded, nutritionOS assumes that
the listed foods are **generally available**.

Based on that assumption, the system:
- designs simple, budget-friendly recipes
- suggests filling everyday meals
- combines ingredients with cost, availability, and leftovers in mind

For this to work reliably, the listed foods should actually be available
in your pantry.

The list below can be used as a **shopping list**.

## Customizing the preset

This preset is **optional** and can be modified.

If you do not want to use a specific food:

1. Remove the corresponding entry from the **index list**
2. Remove the associated food entry including its nutritional data
   from the food database file

After removal, nutritionOS will assume that the food is **not available**
and will no longer use it in its suggestions.

## Note

This pantry preset is a **budget-oriented convenience option**
for everyday nutrition.

It is not a diet, medical, or therapeutic product
and does not make promises about weight or health outcomes.
