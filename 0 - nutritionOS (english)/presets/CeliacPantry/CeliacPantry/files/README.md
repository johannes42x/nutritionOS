# CeliacPantry – Usage

This directory contains a preconfigured gluten-free pantry preset
for nutritionOS.

## Basic principle

nutritionOS explicitly allows users to manually define and maintain
their own food inventories.  
If you do that, **you do not need this preset**.

This preset is intended for users with celiac disease
or a gluten-free diet who do not want to manually enter all foods
and prefer to work with a verified, everyday baseline instead.

## Using the preset

When this pantry preset is loaded, nutritionOS assumes that
the listed foods are **generally available**
and gluten-free.

Based on that assumption, the system:
- designs gluten-free recipes
- suggests suitable meals
- combines ingredients into everyday dishes

For this to work reliably, the listed foods should actually be available
in your pantry.

The list below can be used as a **shopping list**.

## Customizing the preset

This preset is **optional** and can be modified.

If you do not want to use a specific food:

1. Remove the corresponding entry from the **index list**
2. Remove the associated food entry including its nutritional data
   from the food database file

After removal, nutritionOS will assume that the food is **not available**
and will no longer use it in its suggestions.

## Note

This pantry preset is a **convenience and safety option**
for everyday gluten-free nutrition.

It is not a medical or therapeutic product
and does not replace professional medical advice.
