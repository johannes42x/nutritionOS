# GewuerzPantry – Usage

This directory contains a preconfigured spice and flavor pantry for nutritionOS.

## Basic principle

nutritionOS explicitly allows users to manually define and maintain
their own spices, seasonings, and flavor agents.  
If you do that, **you do not need this preset**.

This preset is intended for users who want to work with
a practical, universal baseline of spices and aromatics
without entering them individually.

## Using the preset

When this spice pantry preset is loaded, nutritionOS assumes that
the listed spices and flavor agents are **generally available**.

Based on that assumption, the system:
- develops recipes with sufficient flavor depth
- varies and refines dishes
- combines ingredients in a coherent and practical way

For this to work reliably, the listed spices and aromatics
should actually be available.

The list below can be used as a **shopping or inventory list**.

## Included spices and flavor agents

- Salt  
- Black pepper  
- Sweet paprika  
- Smoked paprika powder  
- Curry  
- Turmeric  
- Cumin  
- Coriander seeds  
- Garam masala  
- Pul biber  
- Cayenne pepper  
- Ground ginger  
- Garlic granules  
- Onion granules  
- Oregano  
- Thyme  
- Basil  
- Rosemary  
- Dried parsley  
- Dried dill  
- Sumac  
- Dried lemon zest  
- Dried orange zest  
- Rose water  
- Maple syrup  
- Agave syrup  
- Honey  
- Nutritional yeast  
- Soy sauce  
- Miso paste  

## Customizing the preset

This preset is **optional** and can be modified.

If you do not want to use a specific spice or flavor agent:

1. Remove the corresponding entry from the **index list**
2. Remove the associated product entry completely

After removal, nutritionOS will assume that the item is **not available**
and will no longer use it in its suggestions.

## Note

This GewuerzPantry is a **foundational preset**.
It provides basic flavor infrastructure for everyday cooking
and is assumed or complemented by some other nutritionOS presets.

It does not sell recommendations,
but reduces setup and cognitive overhead when cooking.
