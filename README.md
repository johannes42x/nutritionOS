## What is nutritionOS?

nutritionOS is a method and product for supporting everyday nutrition, cooking, and dietary decision-making using persistent, file-based logs and reasoning-based decision logic.

Instead of calorie-only tracking or opaque recommendation engines, nutritionOS works with:

- real meals and recipes
- your actual pantry
- individual goals (deficit, maintenance, recovery, performance)  
- subjective states (hunger, stress, illness, fatigue)  
- ethical, medical, and practical constraints  
- long-term nutritional patterns  

to provide adaptive, explainable nutrition decisions grounded in real context.

nutritionOS is part of the MetaMemoryWorks (MMW) ecosystem, but can also be used as a standalone module.

## Core Capabilities

- Persistent evaluation of food logs, meals, and recipes  
- Context-aware calorie and macro balancing (training, rest, illness)  
- Adaptive recipe scaling to meet remaining daily or weekly targets  
- Explicit handling of constraints (vegetarian/vegan, allergies, intolerances)  
- Long-term pattern recognition across days and weeks  
- Clear, text-based guidance with explicit uncertainty handling  

nutritionOS prioritizes sustainability, realism, and bodily feedback over rigid optimization or dietary ideology.

---

## What nutritionOS is not

- Not a calorie counter app  
- Not a diet plan generator  
- Not a medical or therapeutic system  
- Not a behavioral gamification tool  
- Not a moral or normative nutrition framework  

nutritionOS does not provide medical advice and does not override bodily signals or health-related constraints.

---

## Method & Architecture

nutritionOS follows a file-based, persistent OS paradigm:

- user data lives in explicit files (logs, recipes, states, presets)  
- decisions reference historical nutritional context  
- deviations are treated as signals, not failures  
- uncertainty is preserved instead of being filled with guesses  

The protected scope includes both:

- the method (decision logic, persistence model, constraint handling)  
- and products implementing it  

Renaming components or changing formats does not remove licensing obligations if the functional method is reproduced.
