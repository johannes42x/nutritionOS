# nutritionOS – Prior Art Archive

This directory documents the conceptual, structural, and functional origins of **nutritionOS**, including the method, schema architecture, logging logic, and interaction patterns that define the system.

The purpose of this archive is to establish clear prior art for:

- the method of constructing a **file-based, persistent-memory nutrition assistant**,  
- the **append-only logging model** for daily nutrition entries,  
- the modular schema structure used to represent **food databases, recipes, supplements, user profiles, and logs**,  
- the evaluation, summarization, and recommendation procedures performed by nutritionOS,  
- and all functional mechanisms derived from these concepts.

Files placed in this directory serve to:

- Demonstrate the original authorship and development timeline.  
- Document the method in both abstract and concrete forms.  
- Form a verifiable basis for licensing, derivative-work classification, and protection.

This directory does **not** grant rights to reproduce, commercialize, or implement nutritionOS.  
All rights are governed exclusively by the license at the repository root.
